# skin_talk

A new Flutter project.

Flutter Project that I built in 2 days in a hackathon , with a team of backend and ML devs.
SkinTalk scans the skin and based on tha ML model it gives user skin recommendations
User can also appoints the nearby and suitable dermatologist at a certain price.

## backend model not working right now ,

This was just a prototype.
